    <h2>Eligibility</h2>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eligibility refers to which students can do what (you can think about it as per-election per-student permission system)</li>
            <li>There are 2 types of eligibility: per-election and per-position/role</li>
            <li>Per-election controls whether the election is visible to the student or student</li>
            <li>Per-position/role controls whether a certain role is visible to the student and what (s)he can do - nominate/vote/both/neither</li>
            <li>
                Both types of eligibility are automatically generated when you activate the election but this behaviour
                can be disabled via "Disable automatic eligibility" flag on individual election.
                <span class="text-danger">Caution:</span> if you enable this flag, you will need to use the eligibility
                debugger to allow students access to election
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Timings, schedules, etc</h2>

    <p>
        The system makes heavy use of background task queues and as such an action that is confirmed in GUI (eg. activating an election)
        might not instantly take effect - a delay of up to 1 minute is expected. Same thing applies to emails - they may
        be sent with a slight delay. <br/>
        <br/>
        Please note that the system will try to self-recover in most cases but if something (eg. starting nominations
        at scheduled time) is taking more than 5 minutes it probably means that there is an issue and the IT should be notified
    </p>
